    <!--Poem-->
    <p>I met a traveller from anantiquel and, <br/> 
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
        Stand in the desert ....Near them, onthes and, <br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visagelies, whose frown, <br/>
        Andwrinkledlip, and sneer of cold command, <br/>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br/>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifelessthings, <br/>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
        Andonthepedestal, these words appear:<br/>
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br/>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
        Nothing besidere mains. Round the decay<br/>
        Of that colossalWreck, boundless and bare<br/>
        The lone and levels and sstretch far away.”<br/> </p>
